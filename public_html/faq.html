			<div id="faq-headers">What kind of services do you offer?</div>
			<p>
				We are an interfaith Retreat Center offering an array of day and weekend classes, groups, and retreats.  We also rent our facility to outside groups to hold their own events.  We have spiritual direction and space for private time available.  Are you asking for a group or you as an individual?
			</p>
			<br />
			<div id="faq-headers">What is your facility like?</div>
			<p>
				We are located in the hills of Encino on 10 acres of hilly, wooded property.  We have 4 meeting rooms for groups of 2 - 120.  A lovely dining room that serves buffet style meals for up to 150 persons.  We have 24 bedrooms for overnight guests with a maximum capacity of 48.  All of our meeting rooms and bedrooms are heated as well as air-conditioned.
			</p>
			<br />
			<div id="faq-headers">Do you have a chapel or Sunday Mass?</div>
			<p>
				We have a beautiful chapel that is available for our guests to use.  We do not hold regular Mass services, but you are welcome to use the chapel for your own Mass and prayer services.  We do not have clergy on staff, though we can recommend Catholic Priests that may be available for your event.
			</p>
			<br />
			<div id="faq-headers">Can we prepare our own meals?</div>
			<p>
				No, we do not let outside groups cook in our kitchen, but you are welcome to bring in food from outside.
			</p>
			<br />
			<div id="faq-headers">Do you accept kids? Are there any recreation activities available?</div>
			<p>
				We do accept youth for day events, they must be adequately supervised.  This is an adult facility.  We do have a volleyball area, but there is not alot of area for running and playing.  You may bring children with you for an overnight event if you have informed us when making the reservation and it is suitable for the time period you have reserved.
			</p>
			<br />
			<div id="faq-headers">How do we make a reservation?</div>
			<p>
				Find a date/dates that works for your group and our calendar.  We take all the necessary information.  You should receive a contract in the mail.  You must return a signed copy of that contract with the requested deposit by the date indicated to secure your reservation.
			</p>
			<br />
			<div id="faq-headers">How much is the deposit, and what is the cancellation policy?</div>
			<p>
				For a day event the deposit is $300 - non-refundable within 6 months of an events.
			</p>
			<p>
				For an overnight or longer the initial deposit is $500 - non-refundable within 6 months of an event.  We do request an additional deposit to bring the deposit balance to 1/3 six months from the event.  If you do cancel within the 6 month window, you will forfeit all deposits.  If we are able to book another equivalent retreat, we will refund the additional deposit amount.
			</p>
			<br />
			<div id="faq-headers">Are there minimum numbers required?</div>
			<p>
				You tell us what the minimum and maximum numbers of attendees are likely to be and we will contract accordingly.  We place groups in meeting rooms depending upon availability, size of group, and group activities.  You need to be specific when making your reservation.  If you book a group of 45 - 50 persons and a month prior find that you may only have 20 - 25, please call and let us know so that we can plan space & staff accordingly.  If you do not give us adequate warning of a significant reduction in numbers per your contract, you may be responsible to pay for the original minimum contracted amount.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the flip side, if your group is much larger than expected we need to know so you have an adequately sized meeting room and/or enough bedrooms for your attendees.  If you book for a small group - we also reserve bedrooms accordingly.  Please call as soon as you know that you may need additional overnight space.

				We accept checks, cash, and credit cards.  You are expected to pay the balance of your event on the day of OR at the conclusion of your event.  Please have an accurate count of attendees.  We can bill if prior agreement has been made.
			</p>
			<br />
			<div id="faq-headers">How far in advanced do we need to make a reservation?</div>
			<p>
				As far as you can think!  We generally make reservations up to 2 years in advance.  Weekends and Saturdays book the fastest.  The busiest times are January to mid-June and mid-September to Thanksgiving.

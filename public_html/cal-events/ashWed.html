			Lent is the season we are invited into an extended retreat of forty days. It is the season Jesus calls us to prayer, fasting, and alms giving. It is a time of renewal and spiritual growth, of conversion and new life, leading to Easter and Resurrection with the potential to transform every aspect of our lives. So we invite you to join us for our day of prayer on Ash Wednesday as we begin communally this season of renewal. The day will provide time for prayer and reflection, input from Abbot Joseph Boyle on DVD (a moving presentation filled with much wisdom), sharing together, and the distribution of ashes.

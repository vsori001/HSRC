			Come and enjoy relaxing art sessions with Sherry Magdalen. Sherry&rsquo;s approach is simple &mdash; she wants to offer an opportunity for people to flex their creative muscle and focus on the present moment through the use of color and shape. In this way, participants can hear the &ldquo;still voice&rduo; of God. over three years, Sherry worked with the women at the Yellowstone Home for Women which is located in Newport Beach. The sessions will make use of water color, pastels, charcoal and collage. Each session is a freestanding session. Free-will donation gratefully accepted.

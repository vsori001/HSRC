			<p>
				We continue to gather at the well monthly for silent reflection, group discussion, mutual support,
				and just plain good times! Last year we began working with Joyce Rupp's book, <u>Open the Door</u>
				and have found it to be a very challenging and transformative experience! As always, new members are 
				welcome! Our time together includes prayer, ritual, music, quiet reflection, small group sharing, and
				Tai Chi. Come join us around the well!

				Registration not required.<br />
				$10 per session.

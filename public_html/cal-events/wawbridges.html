 				Our evening Women at the Well group will be continuing its work with Bridges to Contemplative Living.  If you've been interested in Bridges, but can't attend the day group, here is your chance!  The daytime group is beginning to work with Book 5, which is pretty far advanced.  This group will be beginning Book 3, so you might consider joining this goup to get a fuller experience of the series and a good grounding in the method of Contemplative Dialogue.  Bridges to Contemplative Living is a program which promotes a deeper and more enriching way of living your life.  You don't have to be already involved in contemplative prayer, just interested in deepening your relationship with God.  We do some contemplative prayer as part of each evening and there is also time for quiet reflection and group dialogue.  We gather every third Thursday of each month from 7:00pm to 9:00pm.  If you have any questions, please call Sr. Chris at (818) 784 - 4515 ext. 354.

 				Our evening gathering continues to meet with a
				small but devoted group of women. As with our
				daytime group, we are always open to new
				members. In September of 2009 we began the
				Bridges to Contemplative Living series, which is
				based partly on the writings of Thomas Merton.
				We are just beginning book three for our Bridges
				gatherings and are loving the program! Bridges
				fosters a deeper, more contemplative life by
				encouraging a proper relationship to God, self,
				others, and nature. Our gatherings also include
				prayer, reflection time, support, contemplative
				dialogue, and Centering Prayer. It's a wonderful
				and restful way to end the day. Come explore the
				riches of living life on a deeper and more
				meaningful level!

				Registration not required.<br />
				Suggested donation of $5 per session.

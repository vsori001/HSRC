			<p>Ash Wednesday initiates the season of lent and invites Christians to enter into the desert. The desert invokes images of a vast land, a timeless beauty, filled with awe, curiosity and longing. The desert is a place where life both clings and thrives, sometimes briefly, other times for centuries. It is not what we do in the desert, it is what happens to us there. Set aside a few hours this Ash Wednesday to consciously enter the desert of life and welcome God as your companion. This day will have time for input and personal reflection. We will bless and receive ashes as a sign of our willingness to be open and to await God&#8217;s transforming love to do its work on us.</p>

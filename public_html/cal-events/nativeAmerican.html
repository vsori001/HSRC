      	<h1>Native American Spirituality:<br/> We Are God's Beadwork!<br/>
        <span>Presented by Luella Wagner, Educator</span></h1>
        <h2>November 7, 5:00pm - November 9, 1:00pm</h2>
        <p>This weekend retreat will engage with the Native American vision and spirituality. Our sisters and brothers and all creatures that call our earth "home" have a message of harmony and oneness for us. Each person will ask: How does my life fit into God's big plan? Am I living my life in balance with all of creative, or do I feel "out of sync"?</p>
        <p>We will explore the symbolism of the Medicine Wheel and its connection with the seasons. We will bless the four directions as part of the Medicine Wheel ritual. Working with beads, we will calm mind and heart by focusing our energies on the small. Our lives are composed of strings of small beads . . . small acts that form the framework of our lives. Beadwork provides a unique opportunity to meditate and calm the mind.</p>

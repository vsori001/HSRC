			Our Bridges group has entered its fifth year!
			People who attend the meetings describe them as
			transformative and grace-filled. Based partly on
			the writings of Thomas Merton, this series gently
			leads participants on a journey towards personal
			spiritual transformation and a more
			contemplative, peace-filled life. Bridges fosters a
			proper relationship to God, self, others, and
			nature. Each session offers an introduction to
			Merton and contemplative living through prayer,
			readings from Merton and other spiritual masters,
			and questions for contemplative dialogue. You do
			not have to be a practitioner of contemplative
			prayer - just someone longing to live in a deeper
			and more enriching way. New members are
			welcome.
